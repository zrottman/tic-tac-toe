    "# Tic-Tac-Toe: Representing the Board and Detecting Winners\n",

    "I recently coded up a quick'n dirty [command line tic-tac-toe game](https://github.com/zrottman/tic-tac-toe) as part of a coding exercise. It seems like a simple task but actually involved some compelling challenges, in particular conceiving of how to represent the board so that its current state could be displayed on the command line and, more importantly, evaluated after each turn for a winning scenario (or stalemate, as the case may be). It was rewarding enough of a puzzle that I wanted to share some of my thinking, go through the various options I explored, and discuss why I ended up making the decision that I did.\n",
